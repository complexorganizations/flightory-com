## Aerodynamic Characteristics

The Super Stingray utilizes the Selig S5020 airfoil, offering superior aerodynamic efficiency. The aircraft maintains longitudinal stability with a center of gravity set at 60mm from the leading edge. The optimal aerodynamic performance is achieved between 2 and 4 degrees of angle of attack (AoA) at cruising speeds of 60-90 km/h. With the recommended motor, propeller, and 4S battery, the aircraft flies steadily at approximately 40% power, resulting in an average current draw of 5A and providing nearly 3 hours of flight time. The design allows for flexibility in motor and battery choices, catering to user preferences.
