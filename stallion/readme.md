## Aerodynamic Characteristics

The Stallion's aerodynamic design is optimized using CFD analysis and real-world flight testing. The geometry is tailored for maximum efficiency and stability, utilizing the Eppler E205 airfoil. With a center of gravity set at 60mm from the leading edge, the aircraft achieves longitudinal stability and a zero pitching moment at zero angle of attack. The highest aerodynamic efficiency is achieved between 0-2 degrees AoA at cruising speeds of 60-70 km/h. The aircraft maintains steady flight at around 40% power with a recommended motor, propeller, and 4S battery, drawing an average of 4A current for over 4 hours of flight time. The design also allows for the use of a 3S battery, providing significant power reserve.
