## Aerodynamic Characteristics

The Lark's aerodynamic design ensures high performance and stability. The Eppler E193 airfoil was selected for its superior characteristics. The geometry of the wing and tail boom, along with their mutual position and incline angles, have been optimized to ensure optimal performance. The aircraft operates efficiently between 0 and 2 degrees of angle of attack (AoA) at speeds of 50 to 60 km/h. With a center of gravity positioned 66mm from the leading edge, the Lark maintains steady level flight at around 30% power, drawing an average current of 4A and delivering over 4 hours of flight time.

## CFD Results

The geometry of the Lark has been designed to provide the best possible aerodynamic characteristics. The Eppler E193 airfoil was selected for its superior performance. The aircraft's longitudinal stability is ensured by a fair margin, and with the center of gravity properly adjusted, it achieves horizontal flight at zero angle of attack without any pitch moment. Optimal angles of attack are in the range of 0 to 2 degrees, with cruising speeds that maximize flight time between 50 and 60 km/h.
