# pico Talon - Flightory

## Overview

The **pico Talon** is a compact 900mm wingspan 3D printed FPV plane designed for both long-distance flights and smooth cruising. Its push-propeller configuration makes it suitable for flying in small spaces, even without FPV equipment. The aircraft can be carried fully assembled or with detachable wings for convenience. The modular nose, adaptable for both Walksnail and standard FPV cameras, and the availability of STEP files for customization make the pico Talon a versatile and user-friendly aircraft.

## Features

- **Wingspan**: 900mm
- **Configuration**: Push-propeller
- **Modular Nose**: Adaptable for Walksnail and standard FPV cameras
- **Customizable**: STEP files available for modification
- **Spacious Fuselage**: Fits a Li-on 4S2P battery for up to 2 hours of flight

## Aerodynamic Characteristics

The pico Talon is designed with optimal aerodynamic characteristics for stable and efficient flight. The Eppler E205 airfoil was selected after extensive testing to ensure longitudinal stability. With the center of gravity properly adjusted, the aircraft maintains horizontal flight at zero angle of attack without pitch moment. The optimal angles of attack range from 0 to 2 degrees, and cruising speeds that provide the greatest flight time are between 55 and 75 km/h.

## CFD Results

The geometry of the pico Talon has been designed to provide the best possible aerodynamic characteristics. During preliminary testing, various airfoils were evaluated, and the Eppler E205 was selected for its superior performance. The aircraft's longitudinal stability is ensured by a fair margin, and with the center of gravity properly adjusted, it achieves horizontal flight at zero angle of attack without any pitch moment. Optimal angles of attack are in the range of 0 to 2 degrees, with cruising speeds that maximize flight time between 55 and 75 km/h.
