## Features

- **Wingspan**: 1400mm
- **Flight Time**: Up to 4 hours with a large Li-Ion 4S6P battery
- **Modular Design**: Easily customizable with provided STEP files
- **Two Tail Variants**: Accommodates popular motor sizes

## Aerodynamic Characteristics

The Talon 1400's aerodynamic design ensures high performance and longitudinal stability. The Eppler E205 airfoil was selected for its superior characteristics. The geometry of the wing and V-tail stabilizers, along with their mutual position and incline angles, have been optimized to ensure optimal performance. At around zero angle of attack (AOA), the aircraft shows no pitching moment. The optimal aerodynamic performance is achieved within the range of 0 to 2 degrees of AOA and at speeds between 55 and 65 km/h. With a proper center of gravity position of 65mm from the leading edge, the aircraft does not require any trim and can fly in manual mode without a flight controller.
