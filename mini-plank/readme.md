## Features

- **Wingspan**: 650mm
- **Configuration**: Plank layout
- **Modular Nose**: Available in FPV or clean versions, provided in STEP format for customization
- **Customizable**: STEP files available for easy editing
- **Spacious Fuselage**: Accommodates all necessary components

## Aerodynamic Characteristics

The Mini Plank's aerodynamic design ensures stability and good flight characteristics. The PW75 airfoil, specifically designed for planks, provides excellent performance. The center of gravity is located 35mm from the leading edge, maintaining stability and a zero pitching moment at zero angle of attack. Optimal angles of attack range from 2 to 4 degrees, with a cruising speed between 45 and 55 km/h.

## CFD Results

The geometry of the Mini Plank has been designed to provide the best possible aerodynamic characteristics. The PW75 airfoil was selected for its superior performance. The aircraft's longitudinal stability is ensured by a fair margin, and with the center of gravity properly adjusted, it achieves horizontal flight at zero angle of attack without any pitch moment. Optimal angles of attack are in the range of 2 to 4 degrees, with cruising speeds that maximize flight time between 45 and 55 km/h.
